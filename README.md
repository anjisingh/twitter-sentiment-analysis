# twitter-sentiment-analysis
Well in this project we are fetching trends with the help of hashtags and then displaying them in form of a pictorial representation. Moreover, like, we are using #narendramodi as  the hashtag, so we will fetch how many are in support of him and how many are not. This will make a clear view of how the hashtag is being popular among people around us.
We have used Java as the programing language.
All the user ids are being collected together in a csv file which will help  in representing the analysis in a pictorial format.
One thing we have mostly done is data mining for various hashtags for similar interests.
Hence, using twitter4j, bringing together all the tweets, retweets, followers etc we get a trending hashtag or say sentimental analysis.
